# In-memory user database

Created the class [User](src/main/java/com/in28minutes/rest/webservices/restfulwebservices/user/User.java)
to use it with the in-memory database (Java ArrayList) defined in the class
[UserDaoService](src/main/java/com/in28minutes/rest/webservices/restfulwebservices/user/UserDaoService.java).

This project has no endpoints implemented to expose CRUD operations for the `User` resource. These features will be
developed during the next exercises.

To run this project place into to this directory and run:

```
$ mvn clean spring-boot:run
```
